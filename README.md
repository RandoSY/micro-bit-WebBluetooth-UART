# micro-bit-WebBluetooth-UART

Demo send & receive data with micro:bit Web Bluetooth UART service.

I created a simple demo to send and receive data with m:bit UART service. The code is purely written in the JavaScript block PXT editor and the HTML5 app for the web bluetooth app running on Chrome browser.

More details on the UART service can be found on the following link:
